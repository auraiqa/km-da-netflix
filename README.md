üçø Netflix India ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis

This project was created during my project-based internship at Rakamin Academy as part of a data exploration exercise. I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix content available in India, focusing on content types, primary genres, release trends, and monthly update patterns.

The notebook includes insights such as:

- Distribution of genres (including primary genre separation)
- Most frequent ratings and release years
- Monthly heatmap of content updates across years (excluding 2016)

With the help of Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I visualized patterns that could guide future content strategies or viewer behavior analysis. While this is a simple EDA project, it helped sharpen my data wrangling and storytelling skills. Always open to feedback or suggestions!
